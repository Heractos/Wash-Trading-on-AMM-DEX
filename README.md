# Wash Trading Detection on AMM Decentralized Exchanges

## Abstract

Due to the recent rise in popularity of Automated Market Maker Decentralized
Exchange, illicit conduct has become widespread in those marketplaces. As
there were no studies that evaluated how to detect and quantify wash trading
in these exchanges, this research employs a basic z-score statistical method to
propose a solution. The complexity of the issue lies in the specificity of the
on-chain data, as AMM DEX transactions do not have the bilateral data to
implement existing methods for the identification of these activities. This re-
search develops a straightforward yet effective approach to finding or analyzing
AMM DEXs, such as Pancake Swap or UniSwap. The results represent only
a small portion of the potential wash traded volumes, but it efficiently defines
the types and patterns of these malicious activities.
